1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

**By far the most interesting topic covered was learning the how fMRI scans work in the data perspective. Knowing how the scans work gives so much insight how we actually read the data.**

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.\

**For an investigation for quarter 2 it would be really nice to use our group generated fMRI data from the UCSD fMRI machine. Especially compare how most available fMRI compares to what we got from a scan.**

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

**I think moving away from PCA for the first quarter would've been beneficial, because it is not directly related to what we are interested in.**

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

**ICA deep learning signal seperation would be very interesting to see how our basemodel compares and include any additional insights what we got from using a deep learning model.**
